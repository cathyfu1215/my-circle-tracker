ðŸ’¡ FIREBASE WARNINGS FIX GUIDE ðŸ’¡
=====================================================

The Firestore errors you're seeing:
- "projects/undefined/databases/(default)"
- "WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream transport errored"

These are common in React Native with Firebase and typically happen when:
1. Environment variables aren't loaded correctly
2. Firestore isn't optimized for React Native

ðŸ’» SOLUTION STEPS:

1. MAKE SURE YOUR .ENV IS CORRECT
   You've already verified this with the check-env.js script.
   Your project ID appears to be: my-circle-tracker-c7cbe

2. RESTART YOUR APP COMPLETELY
   $ expo start --clear

3. IF ISSUES PERSIST, TRY THESE MODIFICATIONS:

   A. In services/firestore.ts, wrap all Firestore operations with try/catch:
      try {
        // Firestore operations
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Firestore operation failed:', error);
      }

   B. Consider refactoring to use offline persistence:
      enablePersistence(firestore, {
        synchronizeTabs: true
      }).catch((err) => {
        console.error('Firestore persistence error:', err);
      });

4. FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES
   Make sure your Firestore security rules allow access to your collections.
   Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ Rules and ensure they match your needs.

5. CHECK CONNECTION STATUS
   The errors might be related to network connectivity in the emulator.
   Try using a physical device or ensure the emulator has internet access.
